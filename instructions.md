# Instructions for Students

Welcome to your website! 

Each group will work together to create a document in the programming language called markdown. Then one group member will paste that markdown file on top of the template for your group's song. 

## Step 1: Understanding Markdown

Information about creating a markdown file as a group.

## Step 2: Managing Image Files

The group member in charge of pasting your markdown file into the template will also need to place image files correctly into the website directory.

Please follow these instructions for images:
- Do not use capital letters or spaces in image file names. Please rename the file so that it is all lowercase and there are hypens in between words. (Example: big-image-of-the-band.jpg)
- Ensure that the image file type matches that you typed into the markdown file. A common mistake that leads to a broken image link happens when people type jpg instead of png or jpeg at the end of the file name. Use copy-paste to avoid this.
