# Instructions for Students

Welcome to your website! 

Each group will work together to create a document in the programming language called markdown. Then one group member will paste that markdown file on top of the template for your group's song. 

## Step 1: Understanding Markdown

Information about creating a markdown file as a group.

## Step 2: Managing Image Files

When you download an image for inclusion on your webpage, please change its name according to the following instructions:

- Rename the image to reflect its content.
- Do not use capital letters or spaces in image file names. 
- Please rename the file so that it is all lowercase and there are hypens in between words. (Example: big-image-of-the-band.jpg)
- When you reference your image in the markdown file, ensure that the image file extension matches exactly the file you uploaded. Your image will not work if you type jpg instead of png or jpeg at the end of the file name. Use copy-paste to avoid this.
